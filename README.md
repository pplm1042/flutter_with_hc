# To Google Health Connect Team

Dear team. 

This is Min Park, working as an flutter app developer at Insilicogen. In order to help you, I wrote a sample project for the interlocking part of Flutter and Google Health Connect.

A few modifications have been made to help you understand the code by applying the clean architecture and MVVM pattern.

Thanks for your help.

Best Regards,
Min
